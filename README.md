## 📌 Project Overview

Modern EVs and hybrids generate thousands of sensor readings per second via their OBD-II port — yet almost none of this data is used intelligently. Current systems react to conditions *after* they happen. This project proves that a pure **software-only ML layer** can:

- **Proactively** throttle HVAC power *before* a steep hill drains the battery
- **Predict** how much free energy will be harvested via regenerative braking
- **Classify** a driver's behavior into Eco / Moderate / Aggressive in real-time
- **Detect** dangerous road hazard situations **without cameras or radar**
- **Track** micro-level battery chemical stress events before they cause permanent damage

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the **eVED (Electric Vehicle Energy Dataset)**:
- ~**500,000** rows of real OBD-II telemetry (1-second samples)
- **37** sensor columns per row
- Collected from **5 real EV trips** across Michigan, USA
- Includes: speed, battery SOC, current, voltage, temperature, gradient, elevation, HVAC power, engine RPM, and more

> ⚠️ The raw CSV dataset is **not included** in this repository (too large). You must supply your own compatible OBD-II telemetry CSV through the dashboard upload interface.

**Compatible columns include:**
`Vehicle Speed[km/h]`, `HV Battery SOC[%]`, `HV Battery Current[A]`, `OAT[DegC]`, `Gradient`, `Elevation Smoothed[m]`, `Engine RPM[RPM]`, `Absolute Load[%]`, `Air Conditioning Power[Watts]`, `Heater Power[Watts]`, `Speed Limit[km/h]`, `Intersection`, and more.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. Auto-Training Pipeline
On the **very first launch**, the dashboard automatically detects that no trained models exist and triggers background training:
1. Each feature's `preprocessing.py` is executed — cleans the dataset, engineers features, splits train/test
2. Each feature's `ml_model.py` is executed — trains the model, evaluates performance, saves `.pkl` files via Joblib
3. All subsequent launches load the saved models instantly (< 1 second)

### 2. CSV Upload & Inference
- Upload any compatible OBD-II telemetry CSV via the sidebar
- The uploaded data is passed through each feature's preprocessing pipeline
- Predictions are generated instantly using the pre-trained models
- Results are displayed as interactive Plotly charts and metric cards

### 3. Physics-Informed Labelling (No Manual Annotation Needed)
Because real accident or battery-failure records don't exist in the dataset, we construct labels using **domain physics**:
- **Hazard labels** (F4): Speed excess + intersection proximity + gradient + ice-risk temperature
- **Battery stress labels** (F5): SOC extremity + high current + thermal stress index

## 🖥️ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python **3.10 or higher**
- Git

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajais3000/vehicle-Energy-Intelligence.git
cd vehicle-Energy-Intelligence
```

### Step 2: Create & Activate a Virtual Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Windows PowerShell)
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate (Mac / Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

```

The dashboard will open automatically at **http://localhost:8501**

> 💡 **First Launch:** The app will auto-train all 5 models in the background (takes ~30–60 seconds). Subsequent launches are instant.

### Step 5: Upload Your Data
- Use the **sidebar file uploader** to upload a compatible OBD-II telemetry CSV
- Navigate between the 5 feature tabs using the sidebar menu
- Explore predictions, charts, and metrics!

## 🔬 Key Design Decisions

### Why Random Forest for HVAC (F1)?
HVAC demand follows a **non-linear U-curve** — the heater maxes out in extreme cold AND the AC maxes out in extreme heat. Linear models completely fail here. Random Forest handles this naturally without any mathematical reformulation.

### Why Gradient Boosting for Regen (F2)?
Regenerative braking energy spikes are sharp and non-monotonic (they depend on speed², not speed). Gradient Boosting's sequential error-correction mechanism captures these sharp energy spikes far better than parallel ensemble methods.

### Why XGBoost for Battery Health (F5)?
Only ~7% of rows are "High Stress" events. XGBoost's `scale_pos_weight` parameter forces the model to penalise itself heavily for missing rare dangerous events, while Random Forest would just predict "Low Stress" 93% of the time and call it done.

### Why Joblib over Pickle?
Our ML models contain millions of NumPy array values (decision tree splits). Joblib writes NumPy arrays directly to disk using memory-mapped files — **3–5× faster** saves/loads and **~60% smaller** file sizes than standard Pickle.
